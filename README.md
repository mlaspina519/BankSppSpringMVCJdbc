# Online Banking Application

This is an application designed to perform the tasks of a Bank. Users may log in, and are assigned roles as Customers or Employees.
Customers may open/close accounts, withdraw/deposit money, update their personal information, and perform transfers.
Employees may perform the same actions as Customers, with the addition of opening/closing Customer accounts,
updating Customer information, and removing/creating new Customers.

This is the third iteration of this project, using Spring MVC and Spring Boot.
